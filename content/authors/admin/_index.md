I am a Master's in Computer Science student at [USC](https://www.usc.edu/), and I am expected to graduate in May 2025. Before coming to USC, I completed my undergraduate studies at [HUST](https://hust.edu.cn/) where I earned a BEng in Computer Science and Technology in June 2023.

My research interest is mainly in computer vision, especially focusing on 3D computer vision. I am also exploring the posiblity in natural language processing.
