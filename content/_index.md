        #       * Presented a novel perspective for protecting personal images from malicious editing, focusing on making biometric features unrecongnizable post editing.
        #       * Developed a new algorithm, **FaceLock**, that incorporates facial recognition models and feature embedding penalties to effectively protect against diffusion-based image editing.
        #       * Conducted a crucial analysis of the quantitative evaluation metrics commonly used in image editing tasks, exposing their vulnerabilities and highlighting the potential for manipulation to achieve deceptive results.

        #       * Introduced **SNAP**, the first unified segmentation model capable of working across different point cloud domains including, part-level, indoor, and outdoor domains.
        #       * Developed SNAP as a versatile model, supporting multiple prompt types, including points, bounding boxes, and text, to enable flexible object segmentation.
        #       * Achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets and demonstrated SNAP’s utility as a semi-automated labeling tool for real-world applications.
